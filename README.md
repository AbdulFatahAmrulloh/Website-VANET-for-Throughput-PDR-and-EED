# VANET-website
 This project implements a VANET (Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network) simulation using OMNeT++ and Veins framework, designed to simulate the communication between vehicles and Road Side Units (RSUs) along JL. Jend. Sudirman, Purwokerto. The simulation focuses on evaluating key performance metrics such as End-to-End Delay (EED), Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), and Throughput in real-time under varying conditions.

Through this project, a web interface is developed to monitor and visualize the simulation's real-time data outputs, offering insights into network performance and efficiency. The project allows the configuration of parameters such as the number of vehicles and their speeds, providing customizable simulations to test various scenarios.

Key Features:

Real-time data collection and display of EED, PDR, and Throughput.

Simulation setup based on JL. Jend. Sudirman, Purwokerto for realistic urban traffic conditions.

Web interface for easy interaction and visualization of simulation results.

Configurable simulation parameters including vehicle speed and count.

This repository provides all necessary files, including the simulation configuration, scripts, and web interface, enabling users to run the simulation and observe network performance metrics.
